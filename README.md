# DEFCON-30---Exotic-Data-Exfiltration
Slides from my talk at the Adversary Village, Defcon 30

# Lightning talk: Exotic data exfiltration, Lightning Talk

In this talk we will explore 3 different ideas that could be used for data exfiltration after successful compromise. These techniques, while simple, are quite different from the traditional DNS, SMB, HTTP(S), SMTP abuse cases that have been covered deeply and described in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Source code for each proof of concept code will be made available after the talk.
